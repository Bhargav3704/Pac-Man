# Pac-Man
Pac-Man Using Deep Q- Learning

## Project Overview
 AI agent capable of playing the Pac-Man game using Convolutional Deep Q-Learning. The project leverages reinforcement learning concepts with **convolutional neural networks** (CNNs) to teach the agent to make optimal decisions for navigating the maze, collecting rewards, and avoiding ghosts.

## Key Concepts
### Reinforcement Learning (RL)
The Pac-Man agent learns by interacting with the environment.
Actions lead to rewards or penalties, allowing the agent to learn an optimal policy.

###

### Deep Q-Learning
The agent uses a Q-value function to estimate the quality of a given action in a state.
A neural network (DQN) approximates the Q-values instead of using a table.
###

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
CNNs process the game frames (images) as input, extracting spatial features like maze layout, ghost positions, and pellet locations.
The extracted features are fed into the DQN to make decisions.
